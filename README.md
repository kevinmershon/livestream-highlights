LiveStream Highlights
==

It occurred to me that Twitch's videos index for live stream highlights and
clips is pretty weak, so I've decided to create a manual (for now) index of the
content I have preserved demonstrating my insight and knowledge in the areas of
Clojure, computer science, software engineering, entrepreneurship, etc. Please
enjoy.
